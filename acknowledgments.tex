\section*{Acknowledgments}

I am incredibly grateful to all fantastic people from Cyberbotics and \ac{disal} as this project would not be possible without their help.

Therefore, I would like to thank David Mansolino, my assistant from Cyberbotics, for all time he put in reviewing my code, to all valuable suggestions and comments, and quick responses to my problems.
I learned a lot of practical skills from him.
Nevertheless, I would like to thank Cyrill Baumann, my assistant from \ac{disal}, for his patience, plenty of advice, and efforts to structure the project.

I want to thank Olivier Michel from Cyberbotics for his general support, and especially for his critical problem-solving suggestions.
I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, professor Alcherio Martinoli, from \ac{disal}, for the sincere and valuable encouragement extended to me.

Finally, I thank my family, my friends, and Jelena Banjac for unceasing encouragement, support, and attention.
