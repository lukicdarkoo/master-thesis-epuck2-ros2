Robotics simulations have been proven to be a powerful tool for developing a robot controller as they are easy to set up, cheap, fast, and convenient use.
However, the final objective is usually to deploy the controller on the real robots or even to run the controller on an arbitrary robot.
This thesis presents a \ac{ros2} driver for e-puck2 physical robot and a generalized \ac{ros2} driver for Webots simulated mobile robots. 
The \ac{ros2} drivers expose nearly identical \ac{ros2} interface that allows a controller to interact in the same way with the physical e-puck2 and the simulated robots without changes.
Effectively, it allows the controller developers a seamless transition between simulated and physical e-puck2 robots or other simulated robots.
The \ac{ros2} drivers are validated in multiple scenarios, like navigation and mapping.
The results prove that researchers can quickly validate their \ac{ros2} controllers on the e-puck2 physical or simulated robot and other Webots simulated robots.
