This has led to the development of a multitude of these devices, deployed in the thousands by researchers worldwide. This paper looks at the Khepera IV mobile robot, the latest iteration of the Khepera series. This full-featured differential wheeled robot provides a broad set of sensors in a small, extensible body, making it easy to test new algorithms in compact indoor arenas. We describe the robot and conduct an independent performance evaluation, providing results for all sensors. We also introduce the Khepera IV Toolbox, an open source framework meant to ease application development. In doing so, we hope to help potential users assess the suitability of the Khepera IV for their envisioned applications and reduce the overhead in getting started using the robot.},

They embed elements from diverse ﬁelds such as mechanics, digital electronics, automatic control, signal processing, embedded programming, and energy management.

This article presents the e-puck robot design, which speciﬁcally targets engineering education at university level. Thanks to its particular design, the e-puck can be used in a large spectrum of teaching activities, not strictly related to robotics.

Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al.

It relies on two e-puck robots, some LEGO bricks and the Webots robot simulation software. This benchmark is a survival game where two robots compete against each other for resources in an unknown maze. Like the rats in cognitive animal experimentation, the e-puck robots look for feeders which allow them to live longer than their opponent. Once a feeder is reached by a robot, the robot draws energy from it and the feeder becomes unavailable for a while. Hence, the robot has to further explore the maze, searching for other feeders while remembering the way back to the ﬁrst ones. This allows them to be able to refuel easily again and again and hopefully live longer than their opponent.},

During early development of the Robot Operating System (ROS), keeping track of coordinate frames was identiﬁed as a common pain point for developers. The complexity of this task made it a common place for bugs when developers improperly applied transforms to data. The problem is also a challenge due to the often distributed sources of information about transformations between different sets of coordinate frames. This paper will explain the complexity of the problem and distill the requirements. Then it will discuss the design of the tf library in relation to the requirements. A few use cases will be presented to demonstrate successful deployment of the library.

Traditional design space spans from structured data-oblivious overlays employing greedy routing strategies all the way to unstructured data-driven overlays using naive broadcast-based routing. The two ends of the spectra come with unacceptable prices: the former often exerts considerable overhead on each node for forwarding irrelevant messages, while the latter is di cult to scale due to prohibitive latencies stemming from unbounded node degrees and network diameters.},

	abstract = {Most applications are consisted of several activities that are fulfilled by different processes. And even processes are included different child processes named light processes or threads. The basic idea of dividing the whole activities to processes is followed by the reusability and sharing ideas. Therefore, applications need an IPC mechanism to establish the communication between the processes. Inter process communication that is known as IPC is a collection of mechanisms that meet the communication requirements between processes. System V defines standard for IPC mechanism named SVIPC. Different operating systems implement SVIPC standard in different manner. Therefore programs that are using the IPC mechanism have different structure in other operating systems. On the other hand reproducing program for various operating systems is a time consuming activity. Porting is a solution to writing programs with the least changes to port them on different operating systems. In this survey we present a brief introduction of various IPC mechanisms in the two operating systems and describe porting Windowspsila programs to Linux by mapping the IPC primitives as a solution. We present the porting as a solution to portable IPC programming. While the program is written with windows IPC mechanism can use our wrapper to be able to run in Linux operating system.},

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315094},
	abstract = {We present a system that estimates the motion of a stereo head or a single moving camera based on video input. The system operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated purely from images over previously unseen distances and periods of time.},

Discrete and continuous Homography Matrices are used to recover position, orientation, and velocity from image sequences of tracked feature points. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel encoders also measure linear and angular velocity of mobile robot. A Kalman filter fuses the measurements from the visual and inertial measurement systems. Time varying matrices in the Kalman filter allow each sensor to receive higher or lower weight in situations where each is more or less accurate. Experiments are performed with a camera and a IMU (Wiimote controller) mounted on a mobile robot.},

These are (1) the rotation matrix, (2) a triple of Euler angles, and (3) the unit quaternion. To these we add a fourth, the rotation vector, which has many of the benefits of both Euler angles and quaternions, but neither the singularities of the former, nor the quadratic constraint of the latter. There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described. Our exposition is catered to those who seek a thorough and unified reference on the whole subject; detailed derivations of some results are not presented.},

Various navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation solutions. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. The Navigation2 system is freely available at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 with a rich community and instructions.},
