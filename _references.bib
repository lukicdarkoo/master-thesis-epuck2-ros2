	abstract = {The tf library was designed to provide a standard way to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within an entire system such that individual component users can be conﬁdent that the data is in the coordinate frame that they want without requiring knowledge of all the coordinate frames in the system. During early development of the Robot Operating System (ROS), keeping track of coordinate frames was identiﬁed as a common pain point for developers. The complexity of this task made it a common place for bugs when developers improperly applied transforms to data. The problem is also a challenge due to the often distributed sources of information about transformations between different sets of coordinate frames. This paper will explain the complexity of the problem and distill the requirements. Then it will discuss the design of the tf library in relation to the requirements. A few use cases will be presented to demonstrate successful deployment of the library. And powerful extensions to the core capabilities such as being able to transform data in time as well as in space.},

The job of navigation stack is to produce a safe path for the robot to execute, by processing data from odometry, sensors and environment map. Maximizing the performance of this navigation stack requires some ﬁne tuning of parameters, and this is not as simple as it looks.

It relies on two e-puck robots, some LEGO bricks and the Webots robot simulation software. This benchmark is a survival game where two robots compete against each other for resources in an unknown maze. Like the rats in cognitive animal experimentation, the e-puck robots look for feeders which allow them to live longer than their opponent. Once a feeder is reached by a robot, the robot draws energy from it and the feeder becomes unavailable for a while. Hence, the robot has to further explore the maze, searching for other feeders while remembering the way back to the ﬁrst ones. This allows them to be able to refuel easily again and again and hopefully live longer than their opponent.},

	abstract = {Developments in mobile robot navigation have enabled robots to operate in warehouses, retail stores, and on sidewalks around pedestrians. Various navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation solutions. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. The Navigation2 system is freely available at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 with a rich community and instructions.},

Thanks to its particular design, the e-puck can be used in a large spectrum of teaching activities, not strictly related to robotics.

This full-featured differential wheeled robot provides a broad set of sensors in a small, extensible body, making it easy to test new algorithms in compact indoor arenas. We describe the robot and conduct an independent performance evaluation, providing results for all sensors.

Traditional design space spans from structured data-oblivious overlays employing greedy routing strategies all the way to unstructured data-driven overlays using naive broadcast-based routing. The two ends of the spectra come with unacceptable prices: the former often exerts considerable overhead on each node for forwarding irrelevant messages, while the latter is di cult to scale due to prohibitive latencies stemming from unbounded node degrees and network diameters.},

Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated purely from images over previously unseen distances and periods of time.},

	abstract = {Most applications are consisted of several activities that are fulfilled by different processes. And even processes are included different child processes named light processes or threads. The basic idea of dividing the whole activities to processes is followed by the reusability and sharing ideas. Therefore, applications need an IPC mechanism to establish the communication between the processes. Inter process communication that is known as IPC is a collection of mechanisms that meet the communication requirements between processes. System V defines standard for IPC mechanism named SVIPC. Different operating systems implement SVIPC standard in different manner. Therefore programs that are using the IPC mechanism have different structure in other operating systems. On the other hand reproducing program for various operating systems is a time consuming activity. Porting is a solution to writing programs with the least changes to port them on different operating systems. In this survey we present a brief introduction of various IPC mechanisms in the two operating systems and describe porting Windowspsila programs to Linux by mapping the IPC primitives as a solution. We present the porting as a solution to portable IPC programming. While the program is written with windows IPC mechanism can use our wrapper to be able to run in Linux operating system.},
